            IG Trucks isn’t just any truck stop—it’s a game-changer. 
            Launched in 2022, this powerhouse of a rest stop quickly became the go-to haven for truck drivers
             on the road. With spacious parking, top-tier facilities,
              and a fast-food experience that rivals
              the best, BIG Trucks is where drivers refuel both their rigs and their appetites.

             A true one-stop shop for relaxation, hearty meals, and quick service,
             we've created a place that feels like home on the road. 
             No longer just a pit stop, BIG Trucks is a destination—where long hauls meet comfort and
              convenience, 
            and where drivers can recharge in style. It’s been nothing short of a hit, and as we keep growing,
             there's no stopping this unstoppable force in the trucking world.

            Get ready, because BIG Trucks is just getting started—and we're here to stay.
