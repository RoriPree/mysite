    <p>BIG Trucks was founded in 2022 with one goal in mind:
         to create a truck stop that truly caters to the needs of truck drivers.
        Inspired by the challenges truckers face on the road—long hours, lack of comfort,
        and limited services—you saw an opportunity to
         create a space that offered more than just fuel and snacks.
         BIG Trucks was designed to be a place where drivers can rest,
          eat well, and access essential
        services in a welcoming environment.

        At BIG Trucks, it’s all about providing comfort, convenience, and appreciation for truckers.
         With spacious parking, quality meals, clean showers, and truck maintenance services, 
         it’s a one-stop destination that makes life on the road easier. More than just a stop, 
        it’s a community where drivers are valued and their hard work is recognized. </p>
